# Objective

Welcome Microsoft, the Bomb Squad has prepared a deep analysis of data sourced from the most credible movie databases that exist including TN, TMB, and IMDB. Since this is your first film we spent time creating visualizations to support your best ROI but also the genre, month you should release the movie, as well as the creatives to bring on the project so that you are ready to create a masterpiece that would take the world by storm. 

# What This Repository Includes

This repository includes the analysis of crucial data that supports our insights. You will see that we utilized Pandas and SQL as well as methods of cleaning and organizing the data in a way that allowed us to create insightful visualizations. This includes the calculation of ROI by analyzing numerous columns in different datasets for genre as well as release month. In addition, we utilize tools like Scrapy and Selenium in order to access some metrics our initial round of data did not give us which enabled us to reccomend to you which studios we reccomend you buy out (building a studio can be expensive, so it would be more cost efficent to buy one that is failing and build up from there).
